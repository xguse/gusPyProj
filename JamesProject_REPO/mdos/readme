MDOS: a method for Motif Discovery using Orthologous Sequences

MDOS is a comparative genomics method for regulatory motif discovery. Different from previous
methods, it does not require or use sequence alignments. It is particularly suitable for 
discovering motifs in highly diverged genomes, or genomes with sequence alignments difficult 
to obtain or poor in quality.


To run the program: use the following command line:
usage: perl mdos.pl input.seq kmer_size single_strand(1:single,0:both) with_extension(1:yes,0:no) num_samples

#input.seq: is the filename of input sequences.  The format of the file should start with ">id", followed by 
            two lines of sequences representing sequences from each of the two genomes being compared. 
#kmer_size: size of kmers 
#sing_strand: whether to use single (1) or doulbe (0) for motif search. 
#with_extend: whether to extend discovered kmer motifs to include degenerate codes
#num_samples: number of samples used for estimating mean and variance

For example:
run the following command:
perl mdos.pl test.seq 6 1 1 10 > motif.output

The program will run to discover motifs in sequence test.seq, starting with 6-mers and using 10 samples.
